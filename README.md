# Django Stock Filter App

*For starters, the name of the file "fullstackdcf" is a little misleading. When I started this project, I just wanted to practice using Django and front-end
design concepts. I originally wanted to make this project so that the app would display a discounted cash flow value for the ticker symbol that was searched, but I
instead decided that by having the app just display equity values and ratios instead, I was able to focus moreso on the web design aspect.*

This project was designed while I was learning how to utilize the Django Framework in order to build a backend for web applications. Also, I was learning HTML and 
CSS and wanted to incorporate it into a single project. Thus, this was moreso a learning project for me. 

In these files, you can find the setup for a general django framework, along with a single app called 'search'. This application functions by having a homepage that
acts as a "search engine" in some sorts (think Google) in which the user can search up a desired ticker, and then important stock info will appear. 

A few aspects of the project that I tried incorporating: 
- CSS grid and html sheets 
- CSS design elements
- Django backend framework 
- basic python finance api work (pandas dataframes)

*Note: This project uses a free yahoo finance api, so not every listed US equity will have relevant / accurate data. Thus, this app works best with large / mega cap
stocks but might not work with medium cap and smaller*
